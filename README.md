# Introduction
Welcome to the Dice-Game, a simple and entertaining two-player dice game. The goal of the game is to be the first player to reach a total score of 100 points or more. Players take turns rolling a six-sided die and accumulating points. However, beware of rolling a 1, as it will reset your current score for the turn.

# How to Play
Each player starts with a score of 0.
On your turn, click the "Roll Dice" button to roll a six-sided die.
If you roll a 1, your current score for the turn becomes 0, and it's the next player's turn.
If you roll any other number, it is added to your current score for the turn.
You can choose to "Hold" at any time, which adds your current score to your total score. After holding, it becomes the next player's turn.
The first player to reach or exceed 100 points wins the game.

# Game Interface
The game interface consists of two player sections, each displaying the player's name, total score, and current score for the turn.
The active player is highlighted with a background color.
The dice image displays the result of the player's roll.
Use the "New Game" button to start a new game, resetting all scores.
Enjoy the beautiful design with a responsive layout, making it enjoyable on various devices.

# Winning the Game
The game automatically ends when a player reaches a total score of 100 points or more. The winning player is then highlighted, and the dice is hidden.
