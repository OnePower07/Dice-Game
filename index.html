        <h2>How to Play</h2>
        <p>
          [1] This is a simple dice game where two players take turns to roll a
          dice. Each player's goal is to reach a score of 100 or more.
        </p>
        <p>
          [2] On each turn, a player rolls a dice by clicking the "Roll dice"
          button. If the player rolls a 1, their current score becomes 0, and
          it's the next player's turn. If the player rolls any other number,
          that number is added to their current score.
        </p>
        <p>
          [3] The player can choose to "Hold" at any time during their turn,
          which adds their current score to their total score. Then it's the
          next player's turn.
        </p>
        <p>
          [4] The game continues until one player reaches a score of 100 or
          more. That player wins the game!
